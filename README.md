# Week in Review

Week in Review is a plugin for [OmniFocus][omnifocus] that extracts a week of
completed tasks for you to review.

To use:

1. Install it as a [plug-in][plug-in].
1. Click **Automation > Week in Review**
1. Enter the week start date.
1. Click **OK**.

Week in Review will extract the tasks you completed that week to a new Folder.
You can then do what you want with it; I normally copy them as TaskPaper,
edit for clarity, and send them to stakeholders :smile:.
