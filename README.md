## Use

1.  Click **Automation > Week in Review**
1.  Enter the week start date.
1.  Click **OK**.

Week in Review will extract the tasks you completed that week to a new Folder
and Focus on it.

You can then do what you want with it; I normally right-click the Week in Review
folder in the main view, click **Copy as TaskPaper**, and then paste my tasks
into an editor. I edit for clarity and send them to stakeholders.
